            <p>DishMap is an innovative app designed to help individuals find restaurants that accommodate dietary
              restrictions due to religious practices. Whether you follow halal, kosher, or any other religious dietary
              laws, DishMap allows you to filter restaurants that offer menu options in line with your beliefs. By
              simply inputting your religious dietary needs, the app generates a list of nearby restaurants that provide
              dishes compliant with your requirements. User reviews and ratings from others with similar religious
              dietary practices help ensure that the dining experience is both safe and satisfying.
            <p></p>
            In addition to locating suitable restaurants, DishMap offers detailed information on menu items, including
            certification of halal or kosher dishes, ingredient transparency, and any potential cross-contamination
            risks. The app integrates with GPS to help users find the closest restaurants, and it provides real-time
            updates on new places or changes to existing menus that meet specific religious dietary laws. With
            DishMap, individuals can confidently explore dining options, knowing they can enjoy meals that align with
            their religious beliefs while eating out with ease.</p>
